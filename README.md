# Wordle-Game

Built a simple game like Wordle where we have 6 chances to guess a 5 lettered word.

Contains 2 text files Guesses (contains all possible valid words), and answers (contains the possible words that we choose the secret word from).
app.py contains the main code.

I've commented what task each method performs.

Thanks for reading!
